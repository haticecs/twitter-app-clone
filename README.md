  ## Installation Requirements

  For local development, please ensure your system meets the following [requirements](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/#requirements).


  ### Install the Expo Cli

  ```
  npm install --global expo-cli
  ```

  ### Install dependencies

  ```
  npm i
  ```

  ## Run instructions

  Expo CLI starts Metro Bundler, which is an HTTP server that compiles the JavaScript code of our app using Babel and serves it to the Expo app. It also pops up Expo Dev Tools, a graphical interface for Expo CLI.

  To start the development server, simply run:

  ```
  npm start
  ```

  ### iOS/Android simulator

  After running `npm start` Expo opens a GUI with the Dev Tool. Near the midle left hand side you will see options for running the app i.e. "Run on Android device/emulator", "Run on iOS simulator". Fire up an Android or iOS simulator and select the relevant option.

  ### iOS/Android device

  You can install the Expo client app directly from the Google Play or App Store to your device which allows you to scan the QR code from the Expo Dev tools to run a local version of the app directly on your device. For more info on this please check out the following [guide](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/create-a-new-app/#opening-the-app-on-your-phonetablet)
